- Switch from THM submodule to the open-source THM available in the MOOSE framework
- Added interface to toggle `assume_separate_tallies` option in OpenMC to improve
  performance
- Added a boundary-based coupling of NekRS to a generic MOOSE thermal-fluids code,
  such as SAM, THM, or RELAP-7. Examples and tutorials will follow soon.
