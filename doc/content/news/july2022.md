# July 2022 News

- Added [Doxygen documentation](https://cardinal.cels.anl.gov/doxygen/html/classes.html)
  to our website
- Added interface to write the `usrwrk` array into NekRS field files with the
  `usrwrk_output` option for the Nek-wrapped cases; this can be used to
  visualize heat fluxes/volumetric power densities/boundary conditions/etc. that MOOSE
  sends into NekRS after they are actually interpolated onto the NekRS spectral element mesh
- Added a [tutorial](https://cardinal.cels.anl.gov/tutorials/transfers.html)
   with advice for selecting a MOOSE `Transfer` for your applications
- Allow user to select the `tally_estimator`, to be either tracklength, collision, or analog.
- Added more options for OpenMC heating tally scores; we extended the `kappa-fission` score option
  to include `heating`, `heating-local`, `damage-energy`, and more. These can be used to couple
  non-local power generation (such as from gamma ray interactions) to MOOSE.
- Added fixed source option for OpenMC wrapping, allowing fixed source calculations to be coupled
  to MOOSE
