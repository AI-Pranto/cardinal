# Getting Started

The compilation instructions for Cardinal are almost the same as any
other MOOSE application. There are some small differences depending on
whether you want to use MOOSE's conda environment, or else the compilers/HDF5/etc.
available separately on your system. Please select your case:

- [I want to use MOOSE's conda environment](with_conda.md)
- [I do NOT want to use MOOSE's conda environment](without_conda.md)
