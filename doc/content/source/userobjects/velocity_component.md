When using `field = velocity_component`, the manner in which the velocity
direction is selected is given by the `velocity_component` parameter, which
may be one of:

- `normal`: normal to the face bins (only valid for the side binning user objects)
- `user`: arbitrary user-specified direction, provided with the `velocity_direction`
  parameter
