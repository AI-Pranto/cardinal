# Generating CFD Meshes with MOOSE

Cardinal contains several meshing utilities to help you create meshes
suitable for NekRS CFD simulations from MOOSE
[MeshGenerators](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/source/meshgenerators/MeshGenerator.html).
You can also create meshes with other software, such as Cubit or Gmsh, but we
have collected a number of meshing scripts developed for other applications that you
may find a useful starting point for MOOSE-base dmeshing.
On this page, we provide links to
more documentation.
